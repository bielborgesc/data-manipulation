# Handling Police Data

This was my first job with data manipulation using only the Python language. This work was done in my first semester of college, and after 3 semesters I decide to rewrite the code to see how much I've evolved.

## Objective

The main goal was to rewrite the code using new concepts I've learned since then, concepts like software engineering, clean code, English, data structure and making the code as efficient as possible.

## Development

 * I will explain and list the differences of the two files and their functions so that we can see in depth the optimization of the code.
The file "first_data_manipulation.py" was the first version made and is in Portuguese, the file "new_data_manipulation.py" is the optimized code and is in English.

 * The file "original_database.csv" is the original file found at the link "https://www.kaggle.com/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings", was downloaded in 2020, may have been updated after that date.

 * The file "corrected_database.csv" is a copy of the file "original_database.csv" with some corrections, because the original file had some data not filled and this caused many errors in the application.

 * The file "invented_database.csv" is a file with the same columns as the original dataset, but with dummy data created by me.


## Menu Options

- [1° version] = first verions 
- [2° version] = new version

    ### [1] - Load data of file
            - [1° version] - The "LoadFile" function loaded the data from the file whose name was passed to 
            the variable "file" and then the data was allocated in an array that was also passed via parameter
            to the function.
            - [2° version] - In the new version, we are already using a very strong structure in python which 
            are dictionaries and, unlike the previous version, the function now allocates the data in a class 
            and returns a dictionary with the values.
